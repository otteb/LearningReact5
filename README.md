This repo focuses on one of the most vital operations for React.js - transferring properties. It is the process of sending properties and information across components.
  React enforces a strict hierarchy - a chain of command where properties have to flow down from a parent component to an immediate child component - no skipping is allowed. In addition, all of the communication is one-way from the parent component to the child component/s. A problem with properties is that they can get messy as multiple props are needed to be passed to subsequent generations of children:

The spread operator in ES6 helps to solve this problem. Use ...this.props to access all contents in the props array. This should help cut down on the amount of code that is sent through the parent components to the children components.
